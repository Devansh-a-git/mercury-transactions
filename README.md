## Main Task

1. **For the main usecase of not showing repeated date values, I have used a combination of very basic CSS property and array index tracking.**  
2. **The code is fitted to work with both sorted and unsorted arrays.**

## Additional Information

1. I was asked to create the first draft using AI so I had used Vercel v0.  
2. Vercel used Next.js, hence the directory structure is based on Next.js compatibility.  
3. I have fixed the small mistakes made by AI in the UI.  
4. I have focused only on the table component as I was asked to.  
5. I have used TypeScript for type safety checks.  
6. I have used Material UI in order to give it a more production-like feel.  
7. I have made the code reusable and extendable.  
8. Vercel's component naming rules were incorrect, I have used correct naming syntax in all the components I wrote.
